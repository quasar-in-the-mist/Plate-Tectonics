        "# Objective: Reduce the opponent's Health Points (HP) from 20 to 0. If a player tries to draw from an empty deck, they lose.\n",
        "# Card Types:\n",
        "# Monsters: Placed on the field. They have Attack (ATK) and Defense (DEF). During the combat phase, they attack. If the opponent has monsters, they attack a random monster. If the attacker's ATK is strictly greater than the defender's DEF, the defender is destroyed. If the opponent has no monsters, they attack the opponent's HP directly.\n",
        "# Spells: Played directly from the hand, trigger an automated effect (healing, direct damage, destroying cards), and are then discarded.\n",
        "# Turn Flow: Draw a card ➡️ Play a random card ➡️ Resolve Effects ➡️ Combat Phase.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# The Library: create_card_library() instantiates 10 unique cards. Every time a player builds a deck, they randomly grab 15 cards from this library.\n",
        "# The Hand & Board: The Player class tracks a deck array, hand array, and field array.\n",
        "# Automated Decisions: When play_turn is called, the script forces the player to select a random card from their hand list.\n",
        "# If it's a Monster, it goes to the field list.\n",
        "# If it's a Spell, it hits the resolve_spell logic block, mutates the state (changing HP, deleting items from the opponent's field array, etc.), and disappears.\n",
        "# Combat: The combat_phase loops through every monster on the active player's field and simulates attacks automatically based on the presence of enemy monsters"
